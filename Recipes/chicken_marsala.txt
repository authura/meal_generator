CHICKEN MARSALA

INGREDIENTS:

1-1 1/2 lbs. chicken breasts, pounded 1/4 inch thick
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
salt and pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp butter, divided
1 (8oz) package pre-sliced mushrooms
3 tbsp shallots
2 cloves garlic
2/3 cup chicken broth
2/3 cup heavy cream
2 tsp thyme
2 tbsp parsley

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Place flour, salt and pepper in ziplock bag. Add chicken to bag;
seal tightly and shake to coat chicken evenly. Set aside.

2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flour-dusted 
chicken in pan, first shaking off any excess, cook, turning once, until
chicken is golden and just barely cooked through, about 5-6 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.

3. Melt remaining butter in pan. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently,
until they begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.

4. Add shallots, garlic, and salt; cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.

5. Add broth, wine, heavy cream, thyme, salt and pepper; use wooden spoon
to scrape brown bits from pan to liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat
to medium and gently boil, uncovered, until the sauce is reduced by half,
slightly thickened, and darkened in color, 10-15 minutes.

6. Add chicken back to pan, baste with excess juices. Reduce heat to low and
simmer until chicken is warmed through and sauce thickens, 2-3 minutes.

7. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
